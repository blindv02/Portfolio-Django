    <p>I have been studying self-taught for about 1 year, in addition to the course "Side by Side Python Fullstack"
      promoted by the government of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
      In addition to the self-taught studies, I have experience in systems departments working in networks,
      servers and security cameras, so I have experience working under pressure with the ticket system </p>
